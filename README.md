# stripe-free-amount
Basic Flask-Stripe integration that allows users to choose a donation amount for one-time/monthly donations. Helpful for charities. 

The Stripe documentation is great but does not provide a ready to use integration example for charities. We are hoping that this may save some time to some NGOs.

Stripe also have generous rates for 501(c)(3) organizations. Don't hesitate to contact their sales team.
